# 🛡️ SafeHer: Advanced Women Safety Ecosystem

SafeHer is a state-of-the-art, full-stack safety application designed to provide women with a comprehensive security toolkit. Beyond a simple SOS button, SafeHer integrates real-time tracking, AI-powered threat prediction, discreet evidence collection, and a robust stealth mode to ensure user safety even in the most critical situations.

## 🚀 Project Overview
 


### The Purpose
In an increasingly unpredictable world, personal safety is a paramount concern. **SafeHer** was built to empower women with technology that works seamlessly during emergencies, provides proactive safety measures, and ensures that evidence is secured even if the device is offline or compromised.

### The Problem It Solves
- **Delayed Assistance:** Traditional methods can be slow. SafeHer uses real-time WebSockets to broadcast SOS alerts instantly.
- **Detection Risk:** If an attacker sees a safety app, they may compromise the device. SafeHer includes a **Stealth Mode** that disguises the app as a common utility.
- **Evidence Loss:** Critical evidence (photos/audio) is often lost if a device is taken or internet is cut. SafeHer's **Silent Evidence Collection** works offline and captures data discreetly.
- **Proactive Safety:** Instead of just reacting, SafeHer uses **Threat Prediction** to alert users about potentially unsafe zones.

## 🧠 Complete Feature List

### 👩‍💻 User-Side Features
- **🚨 One-Tap SOS:** Instant emergency broadcast with real-time location.
- **🕵️ Stealth Mode:** Disguise the app as a Calculator, Music Player, or Settings menu.
- **📸 Silent Evidence Collection:** Discreetly capture photos, audio, video, and location coordinates.
- **🗺️ Journey Tracking:** Real-time monitoring of your route with live updates to trusted contacts.
- **🔐 End-to-End Encryption:** Your SOS data and evidence are encrypted locally with a password only you know.
- **👥 Help Network:** Access a community of nearby helpers and emergency services.
- **🧠 Threat Prediction:** Interactive map visualizing unsafe zones based on historical and real-time data.
- **📶 Offline Mode:** Collect evidence and log movements without an active internet connection; data syncs automatically when back online.

### 🛠️ Admin/Security Side Features

## 🧩 System Architecture

SafeHer follows a decentralized yet highly synchronized architecture:

1.  **Client (Frontend):** Runs the main UI, handles local encryption, manages offline evidence storage, and initiates Geolocation tracking.
2.  **Real-time Gateway (NestJS):** A dedicated server handling high-frequency WebSocket connections for SOS broadcasts, ensuring sub-second delivery to the help network.
3.  **Data Layer (Supabase):** Stores user profiles, encrypted evidence, trusted contacts, and historical safety data.
4.  **Integration Services:** Google Maps for visualization and Supabase Edge Functions for background tasks like threat analysis.

**Data Flow:**
`Action Trigger (SOS)` → `Local Encryption` → `WebSocket Broadcast (NestJS)` → `Database Persistence (Supabase)` → `Notification Delivery`
